# Netflix clone
## Stack
This is a recreation of the Netflix website using react, redux, firebase and tailwindcss.

## Content
It has a main page, a tvshow and movies page, as well as a myList page and log-in/sign-in page. All of this in order to have a more complete project and to practice my react skills. In the future more features might be added.

## How to use the page
You can either create an account in the sign-in page with a random email and a password or use the following account: 
* Email: test@test.com
* Pass: Test44

## Tests
Tests were made while learning Jest, but they are for an older version of the page, most of them might be deprecated now. Will update the tests with my new knowledge in further updates of the project.
